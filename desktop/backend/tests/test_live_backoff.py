"""/api/live rebuild sharing + failure backoff: a fresh build is shared across
connections (4s freshness), and a failing symbol backs off exponentially (capped
at 60s) instead of re-hitting upstream on every 5s cadence tick. Success resets
the backoff streak.

The tests shrink the 5s cadence sleep so sessions tear down quickly; backoff
windows are patched to milliseconds and waited out with a (real) thread sleep.
